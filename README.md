## Introduction
To get something quickly up and running for the sake of demonostrating  the solution I have used [devias-io](https://github.com/devias-io/material-kit-react)

They might not have the best architectute in my opinion, for example this was obvious when they repeated navigation for both mobile and desktop in the `side-nav.tsx` and `mobile-nav.tsx` 

I have used Chat GPT to generate some dummy date for Job openings and their details

The prototype idea is simple. A 2 pages application, one for listing all openings created by the client, and a page that shows details and insights about the opening (which is our main concern)

For sake of simplicity I avoided adding all CRUD funtionalities, our user is not able to create, update, or close an opening.


## Getting Started

- install dependecies using `npm i`
- run the app using `npm run dev`
